## Python recursive crawler

### Required Packages:
* requests
* BeautifulSoup

### Info
It's a python beautifulSoup crawler created for **parsing main content without any knowledge of what would the html structure be like**. We designed a recursive function `recursive_get_content` to contruct a dictionary mapping different kind of **tag node** to their contents, then we select the longest one as the `main content` node.
